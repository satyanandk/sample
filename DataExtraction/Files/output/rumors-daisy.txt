@@@begin_origins@@@  A blind man, a golden retriever named Daisy, the selfless rescue of almost a thousand people from one of the collapsing World Trade Center towers — if it all sounds too good to be true, it's because it is. This is a case of the heroic rescue that wasn't. This widely circulated Internet tale of canine courage is pure fiction. One of its more obvious tipoffs is the claim that the imaginary dog went to the 112th floor of the damaged tower to retrieve more victims in need of rescuing. Both World Trade Center towers topped out at 110 floors. One version of the Internet forward concludes with "copied from NEW YORK TIMES 9-19-01." That claim is as fake as the rest of the piece — no such article ran in The New York Times or in any other publication, on that date or any other. At least two men were guided to safety by their guide dogs: Michael Hingson from the 78th floor by Roselle, and Omar Rivera from the 71st floor by Dorado. Neither dog then returned to rescue others, though. The horror that was September 11 is hard for many of us to accept, thus the need for "miraculous rescue" tales such as this one. That they have to be made up apparently doesn't stop some from doing exactly that. Barbara "going to the dogs" Mikkelson@@@end_origins@@@
