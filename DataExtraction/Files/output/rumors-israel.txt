@@@begin_origins@@@  None of us needs any reminders after the events of September 11 about what an ugly place the world can be, but we continue to receive those reminders nonetheless. In this case, there are plenty of anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist, and anti-Israeli groups eager to use the horrors of September 11 as fodder for propaganda to serve their own political ends. The pieces quote above scarely merit the dignity of a rebuttal. One need only have read newspaper accounts of the thousands of deaths, viewed TV news interviews with grieving families, and scanned the lists of the dead and missing to know that the terrorist attack on New York City claimed the lives of Christians, Jews, and Muslims; agnostics, atheists, and the non-religious alike. No religion was spared, no denomination singled out. Ordinary people of all nationalities suffered. No miracles, human intervention, foreknowledge, coincidence, or vagaries of fate saved more than a few World Trade Center workers from meeting their deaths that day. Nonetheless, those with something to gain by sowing the seeds of divisiveness would have us believe that Israel had advance warning of the World Trade Center attack, that they managed to notify 4,000 Jews who worked in the two towers, but that they left the U.S. completely unaware of the danger. ("Hello, David Rosenberg? This is the Mossad. Listen, don't go to work on Tuesday. Yeah, another terrorist attack on the U.S. . . . call in sick. And remember, not a word to any of your gentile relatives, friends, or co-workers.") And even though this scoop to top all scoops winged its way all over the Internet, the American press apparently remains completely in the dark about the nefarious scheme. Is it any surprise that this story emanated from Pravda and Al-Manar Television, the pro-Palestinian "Channel of Arabs and Muslims"? Why would Israel follow such a course of action, betray its staunchest ally, and doom thousands of innocent Americans to death? There are no rational answers to that question, only ugly propagandistic ones. "Israel wants to draw America into a final showdown with its Arab enemies, so they didn't warn us" — the same conspiracy theory that posited our leaders knew about the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor allowed it to happen in order to galvanize public support for a war. Old theory, new clothes. Even darker is the implication that Israel, not content to wait for an attack which would embroil America in a Middle Eastern war, forced the issue by pulling off a monstrous act of terrorism again the USA themselves. "It is clear to all that the Jews/Israel have most to gain and should be considered as a possible source behind this act," we're told. We hope what's clear to all is that those who author and disseminate this kind of garbage are really the ones with the most to gain. Should there still be any doubt, news accounts in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks demonstrate that Jews and Israelis did die in the World Trade Towers that day. A 18 September 2001 CNN article reported on one Manhattan synagogue that had lost six of its members in the attacks, five in the towers and one at the Pentagon. A 21 September 2001 ABC News article showed that at (then) last count 400 Jews were killed in the attack. A 21 September 2001 New York Times article detailed efforts then underway to identify the Jews whose bodies remained beneath the World Trade Center rubble.
